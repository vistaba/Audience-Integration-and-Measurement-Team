# CSV files

There are two csv files in this repository, urls.csv contains all the data that was given to us originally.
urls-isolated.csv contains only the data of the urls. This was used for simplicity purposes in the loop sequence.

# xlsx file

This file contains data used for the word cloud in the tableau dashboard. This is data that was pulled from the first two urls.that data
was pulled from.

# txt file
This contains data that was pulled. It is the raw that was originally used for the word cloud.
